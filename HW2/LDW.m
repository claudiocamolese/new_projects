function [L,D,W] = LDW(W)
% Construct the degree matrix D and the Laplacian matrix L = D âˆ’ W .
%D is the defined as the sum of the row of W
W=sparse(W);
D = spdiags(sum(W,2), 0, size(W, 1), size(W, 2)); % Create diagonal matrix (sparse)
% sum(W,2) is the sum over the row

% Step 2: Compute the Laplacian Matrix L
L = D - W;
